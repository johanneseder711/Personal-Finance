A personal finance dashboard to track current expenses and income streams.
Technology used is web via streamlit api. 
The whole project will be written in python. 

# Basic Goals for me in this projekt are:
* understanding streamlit
* build a simple money visualization possibility
* use api's to get the account information from different banks and brokers
* pratice web scraping if no api's are currently supported for banks or brokers

## Final and ideal output: 
* have a go to website to log in securely where i can see a live dashboard on my current expenses and incomes, total wealth and predicted expen
