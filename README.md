# Personal Finance Tracker
A personal finance dashboard to track current expenses and income streams.
Technology used is web via streamlit. 
The whole project will be written in python. \
This is a personal project based on my interest. Feel free to clone this repo or to make some pull request if needed. **THANKS**

# Basic Goals for me in this projekt are:
* understanding streamlit * build a simple money visualization 
possibility * use api's to get the account information from different 
banks and brokers * pratice web scraping if no api's are currently 
supported for banks or brokers

## Final and ideal output: 
* have a go to website to log in securely where i can see a live 
dashboard on my current expenses and incomes, total wealth and predicted
